        <p><strong>Thank you for participating!</strong></p>

        <p><strong>Purpose of this study:</strong></p>
        <p>This study investigates how people choose to phrase questions when seeking information.
        Specifically, we are interested in whether people's goals influence which question they ask—for example,
        whether asking ""Which are contaminated?"" vs. ""Which are uncontaminated?"" depends on what the person
        wants to accomplish.</p>

        <p><strong>What we're studying:</strong></p>
        <p>We hypothesize that people strategically choose question framing to maximize the usefulness of
        the answer for their specific decision problem. Your responses will help us understand the
        cognitive processes underlying question formulation.</p>

        <p><strong>Confidentiality:</strong></p>
        <p>Your responses are completely anonymous and will only be used for research purposes.
        No identifying information has been collected.</p>

        <p>If you have any questions about this research, please contact sylee423@stanford.edu or rdhawkins@stanford.edu.</p>

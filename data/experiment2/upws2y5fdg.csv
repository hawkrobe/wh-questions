        <strong>IRB#</strong> 77226</p>

        <p><strong>DESCRIPTION:</strong> You are invited to participate in a research study about language and communication. The purpose of the research is to understand how people formulate questions to gather information in uncertain situations. This research will be conducted through the Prolific platform, including participants from the US, UK, and Canada.</p>

        <p><strong>TIME INVOLVEMENT:</strong> The task will last the amount of time advertised on Prolific. You are free to withdraw from the study at any time.</p>

        <p><strong>RISKS AND BENEFITS:</strong> Study data will be stored securely, in compliance with Stanford University standards, minimizing the risk of confidentiality breach. This study advances our scientific understanding of how people communicate and make decisions. We cannot and do not guarantee or promise that you will receive any benefits from this study.</p>

        <p><strong>PAYMENTS:</strong> You will receive payment in the amount advertised on Prolific. If you do not complete this study, you will receive prorated payment based on the time that you have spent.</p>

    <div class=""instructions-box"">
        <p><strong>Thank you for participating!</strong></p>

        <p><strong>Purpose of this study:</strong></p>
        <p>This study investigates how people choose to phrase questions when seeking information.
        Specifically, we are interested in whether people's goals influence which question they ask—for example,
        whether asking ""Which are contaminated?"" vs. ""Which are uncontaminated?"" depends on what the person
        wants to accomplish.</p>

        <p><strong>What we're studying:</strong></p>
        <p>We hypothesize that people strategically choose question framing to maximize the usefulness of
        the answer for their specific decision problem. Your responses will help us understand the
        cognitive processes underlying question formulation.</p>

        <p><strong>Confidentiality:</strong></p>
        <p>Your responses are completely anonymous and will only be used for research purposes.
        No identifying information has been collected.</p>

        <p>If you have any questions about this research, please contact sylee423@stanford.edu or rdhawkins@stanford.edu.</p>
